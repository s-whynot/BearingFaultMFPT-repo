# BearingFaultMFPT
Notebook for detecting Bearing Faults using the Vibration data from the MFPT dataset. 
https://www.mfpt.org/fault-data-sets/

All codes done in Python using Tensorflow library and the Keras API. A case of labeled Classification. These codes contain a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in the form of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The base CNN structure was taken from https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sv/2017/5067651/

Basic code structure is done following the beautiful article https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/03/convolutional-neural-networks-damage-detection/
